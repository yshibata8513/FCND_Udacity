# Required Steps for a Passing Submission:
1. Load the 2.5D map in the colliders.csv file describing the environment.
2. Discretize the environment into a grid or graph representation.
3. Define the start and goal locations.
4. Perform a search using A* or other search algorithm.
5. Use a collinearity test or ray tracing method (like Bresenham) to remove unnecessary waypoints.
6. Return waypoints in local ECEF coordinates (format for `self.all_waypoints` is [N, E, altitude, heading], where the droneâ€™s start location corresponds to [0, 0, 0, 0].
7. Write it up.
8. Congratulations!  Your Done!

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You're reading it! Below I describe how I addressed each rubric point and where in my code each point is handled.

### Explain the Starter Code

#### 1. Explain the functionality of what's provided in `motion_planning.py` and `planning_utils.py`
These scripts contain a basic planning implementation that includes...

And here's a lovely image of my results (ok this image has nothing to do with it, but it's a nice example of how to include images in your writeup!)

### Implementing Your Path Planning Algorithm

#### 1. Set your global home position
I added a few lines of code to load the first line of the csv file , as shown below.

<code> 

    # read lat0, lon0 from colliders into floating point values
    def extract_lonlat(filename):
        with open(filename,"r") as f:
            for row in f:
                break
        (lat_part,lon_part) = row.split(",")
        lat = float(lat_part.split(" ")[1])
        lon = float(lon_part.split(" ")[2])
        return lon,lat
    (lon0,lat0) = extract_lonlat(filename = 'colliders.csv')
    # set home position to (lon0, lat0, 0)
    self.set_home_position(lon0, lat0, 0.0)
        
</code>


#### 2. Set your current local position
I used <code>global_to_local</code> to convert current global position to local position based on home position in at previous step.

<code>

    # convert to current local position using global_to_local()
    _local_position = global_to_local(self.global_position, (lon0,lat0,0.0))        
</code>


#### 3. Set grid start position from local position
I identified the indices of home position in the grid as <code> (-north_offset,-east_offset) </code> and added this to <code>local_position</code> to compute the indices of <code>local_position</code> in the grid. Finally I set the indices as <code> grid_start</code>.

<code>

    # Define a grid for a particular altitude and safety margin around obstacles
    grid, north_offset, east_offset = create_grid(data, TARGET_ALTITUDE, SAFETY_DISTANCE)

    print("North offset = {0}, east offset = {1}".format(north_offset, east_offset))
    # Define starting point on the grid (this is just grid center)
    # convert start  to current position rather than map center
    grid_start = (int(_local_position[0]-north_offset), int(_local_position[1]-east_offset))
</code>


#### 4. Set grid goal position from geodetic coords
First I set latlon of <code>goal</code>position.Second I calculated the indices of <code>goal_position</code> in the grid following same procedure as <code>local_position</code>.Finally I added a simple correction procedure of <code>goal_positon</code> to avoid to set <code>goal_position</code> in obstacles.

<code>

    ## Activate this part when you want to specify goal position using latlon.  
    ## If you want to set the goal position to another latlon ,please modify following two lines
    lon_goal = self.global_position[0] + 0.001
    lat_goal = self.global_position[1] + 0.001
    _grid_goal = global_to_local((lon_goal,lat_goal,TARGET_ALTITUDE),self.global_home)
    grid_goal = ( int(_grid_goal[0]-north_offset) , int(_grid_goal[1]-east_offset) )
    while(1):
        if grid[grid_goal[0],grid_goal[1]] == 0:
            break
        else:  
            grid_goal = (grid_goal[0] - 1 , grid_goal[1] - 1)
    print("grid_goal: {}".format(grid_goal))

</code>


#### 5. Modify A* to include diagonal motion (or replace A* altogether)
I updated the A* implementation to include diagonal motions on the grid that have a cost of sqrt(2).

First I added members of <code>Action</code> corresponding to diagonal motions as follow. 

<code>

    NORTH_EAST = (1, 1, np.sqrt(2))
    NORTH_WEST = (-1, 1, np.sqrt(2))
    SOUTH_EAST = (1, -1, np.sqrt(2))
    SOUTH_WEST = (-1, -1, np.sqrt(2))

</code>
Second I add codes to <code>valid_actions</code> to judge whether each diagonal direction is valid.For example I judge <code>NORTH_EAST</code> is valid if and only if <code>EAST</code> and <code>NORTH</code> are both valid.

<code>

    ## Neast(Nnorth,Nsouth,Nwest) means  
    ## "valid_actions does not include Action.East(Nort,South,West)"
    if Neast or Nnorth or grid[x + 1, y + 1] == 1:
        valid_actions.remove(_Action.NORTH_EAST)
    if Nwest or Nnorth or grid[x - 1, y + 1] == 1:
        valid_actions.remove(_Action.NORTH_WEST)
    if Neast or Nsouth or grid[x + 1, y - 1] == 1:
        valid_actions.remove(_Action.SOUTH_EAST)
    if Nwest or Nsouth or grid[x - 1, y - 1] == 1:
        valid_actions.remove(_Action.SOUTH_WEST)
</code>


#### 6. Cull waypoints 
To decide which points I should eliminates, I used the colliniarity check method as implemeted in <code>check_coliniarity</code>.  
In <code>prune_pathpoints</code> the method start with three points near the starting point, and if it is judged to be collinear, delete the second point, make the third point a new second point, and move the third point one point to the goal side. If it is judged not to be collinear, make the second point a new first point, make the third point a new second point, and move the third point one point to the goal side , and repeat this procedure until the third point is reached.

<code>

    def check_coliniarity(x1,x2,x3,y1,y2,y3):
        det = x1*(y2-y3)+x2*(y3-y1)+x3*(y1-y2)
        return det==0

    def prune_pathpoints(path):
        _path = []
        _path.append(path[0])
        ind1 = 0
        ind2 = 1
        ind3 = 2
        while ind3<len(path):
            (x1,y1) = path[ind1][0],path[ind1][1]
            (x2,y2) = path[ind2][0],path[ind2][1]
            (x3,y3) = path[ind3][0],path[ind3][1]
            colin = check_coliniarity(x1,x2,x3,y1,y2,y3)
            if colin:
                ind2 = ind3
                ind3 += 1
            else:
                _path.append(path[ind2])
                ind1 = ind2
                ind2 = ind3
                ind3 += 1
        _path.append(path[-1])
        return _path
         
</code>
